# MazePrefabs
 Maze Prefab broken into pieces

 0.1 - Pilles Maze 513x523 split into 9 chunks and then aligned through prefabs.xml file
        All chunks align properly, Small coridors and lack of trees means this won't be very exciting gameplay.
        No floor on this maze, so there is grass, there is small wood shrub, I even saw a chicken running through the maze.
        Its possible to finish the first quest in the maze, I could place a trader at the center and then the final part
        of the quest will guide the player to the center.
        I was thinking of placing a town in the middle chunk as the goal of the maze. However, This maze is gigantic.
        268,299 square blocks. A quarter of a million sq blocks to traverse. It doesn't sound fun.

0.2 - Future plans -
            Maze generation program to control corridor size and maze dimensions. 
            Auto chunk and prefabs.xml generation
            Options to fill in the maze with fun stuff:
                Sleepers, animals, prefabs etc.
